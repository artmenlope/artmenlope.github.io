#### About me
I am a PhD student in Physics at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) very interested in quantum technologies. I work in experimental quantum photonics with anti-resonant hollow-core fibres at [EFO-Lab](https://efo-lab.com/). Currently, my main research is focused on tailoring the properties of quantum light. I hold both a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Alicante and a Master's degree in Quantum Science and Technology from the UPV/EHU.
