#### About me
I am a PhD student in Physics at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) interested in quantum technologies. I am working in experimental quantum photonics with anti-resonant hollow-core fibers at [EFO-Lab](https://efo-lab.com/) and, currently, my main research is focused on tailoring the properties of quantum light. I hold both a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Alicante and a Master's degree in Quantum Science and Technology from the UPV/EHU.
