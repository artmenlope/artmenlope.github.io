When studying quantum mechanics, we often find names like Planck, Dirac, Schr√∂dinger and more. However, it can happen that, if we have been more used to the written form of these names, we may not have a clear image of the people behind them. Sometimes a picture is not enough, so in this post I wanted to make a gallery with video recordings of quantum physicists that we usually find in the textbooks.
