<h4 id="about-me">About me</h4>
<p>I am a PhD student in Physics at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) very interested in quantum technologies. I work in experimental quantum photonics with anti-resonant hollow-core fibres at <a href="https://efo-lab.com/">EFO-Lab</a>. Currently, my main research is focused on tailoring the properties of quantum light. I hold both a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Alicante and a Master's degree in Quantum Science and Technology from the UPV/EHU.</p>
